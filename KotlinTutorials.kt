    /*OOP summary
    Why does a paradigm like OOP work better when we already have a funtional way of coding?
    -> While one would indeed see coding as a function based activity where all coded statements revolves around logic of the
       problem statement, it fails to work with human understanding of the world we live in and the data produced by it.
       Maybe in future, when all code is AI generated we will see a huge migration towards new codebases which are biased towards 
       declarative and parallel way of programing. 

    

    //OOP: Classes (general format of comaprable entities within a program 
                    ForEg: One can create a NPC class containg health variable
                    and assign it to all NPCs in the game. As a result, all NPCs in the game now have a health component)
