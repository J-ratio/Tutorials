- This repository is created for the purpose of covering Javascript language syntax in detail.
- Keep in mind that readers are expected to know common principles like conditional statements and loops.
- This folder can also be used as an obsidian vault which is used to navigate through topics more easily. 
- I will be providing a graph view of the entire topic once its finalised.
