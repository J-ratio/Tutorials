Many functions are provided by JavaScript host environments that allow you to schedule _asynchronous_ actions. In other words, actions that we initiate now, but they finish later.
These actions are passed onto a different thread and code execution continues.

`Callbacks` are used to execute code after the async actions have finished executing. For eg,

```javascript
function loadScript(src, callback) {
  let script = document.createElement('script');
  script.src = src;
  script.onload = () => callback(script);
  document.head.append(script);
}

loadScript('https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/3.2.0/lodash.js', script => {
  alert(`Cool, the script ${script.src} is loaded`);
  alert( _ ); // _ is a function declared in the loaded script
});
```


##### Nested Callbacks

At first glance, it looks like a viable approach to asynchronous coding. And indeed it is. For one or maybe two nested calls it looks fine.

But for multiple asynchronous actions that follow one after another, weâ€™ll have code like this:

```javascript
loadScript('1.js', function(error, script) {

  if (error) {
    handleError(error);
  } else {
    // ...
    loadScript('2.js', function(error, script) {
      if (error) {
        handleError(error);
      } else {
        // ...
        loadScript('3.js', function(error, script) {
          if (error) {
            handleError(error);
          } else {
            // ...continue after all scripts are loaded (*)
          }
        });

      }
    });
  }
});
```

As calls become more nested, the code becomes deeper and increasingly more difficult to manage, especially if we have real code instead of `...` that may include more loops, conditional statements and so on.
